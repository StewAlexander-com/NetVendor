![Overview](docs/images/overview.png)
*NetVendor provides comprehensive network device analysis and visualization*

## üìñ Introduction

**NetVendor** is a Python tool for network administrators and cybersecurity professionals to analyze and visualize the vendor distribution of devices on a network. It processes MAC address tables and ARP data from a wide range of network devices (including Cisco, HP/Aruba, Juniper, Extreme, Brocade, and more), providing detailed insights into your network's composition.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-vendor MAC address parsing:** Supports Cisco, HP/Aruba, Juniper, Extreme, Brocade, and more.
- **Flexible input:** Accepts MAC address lists, MAC tables, and ARP tables in various formats.
- **Vendor identification:** Uses a local IEEE OUI cache for fast, secure lookups.
- **Comprehensive reporting:** Generates CSVs, summaries, and interactive HTML dashboards.
- **VLAN and port analysis:** Extracts and visualizes VLAN and port data where available.
- **Extensible and robust:** Easily add support for new formats; thoroughly tested with real-world data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required packages: `requests`, `plotly`, `rich`, `tqdm`
- Input file containing MAC addresses or ARP data from your network devices

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StewAlexander-com/NetVendor.git
cd NetVendor
pip install -e .
```

---

## üìã Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
netvendor input_file.txt
```

### Windows Usage

```powershell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
python3 -m netvendor input_file.txt
```

## ‚úÖ Operational Best Practices

- **Prefer offline vendor lookups**: The OUI cache is seeded and persisted under `output/data/oui_cache.json`. Run once on representative data to warm the cache; subsequent runs avoid external requests and are faster.
- **Avoid parallel CLI runs**: OUI API lookups are rate-limited with backoff and service rotation. For batch processing, run files sequentially to prevent throttling.
- **Let the tool normalize MACs**: Inputs in colon, hyphen, dot, or mask/prefix forms are accepted; output is consistently `xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`.
- **Large input handling**: Use unedited device outputs. The parser skips headers and tolerates mixed casing. Ensure `output/` is writable and on local storage for speed.
- **Port reports**: Generated only for MAC address tables (not ARP or simple lists).
- **Output hygiene**: Clean `output/` between runs in CI or keep it out of version control to avoid stale artifacts.
- **Windows encoding**: Use the environment variables above to prevent encoding issues with device outputs.
- **Security**: Treat MAC/ARP dumps as sensitive. Review `output/data/failed_lookups.json` before sharing artifacts.
- **Reproducibility**: Pin and install dependencies from this repo. Archive `output/data/oui_cache.json` with reports for future re-runs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Considerations

### Performance & Scalability

- **Memory usage**: All devices are loaded into memory as a dictionary. Typical runs with thousands of MACs use minimal memory (<100MB). Very large inputs (100K+ MACs) may require 500MB-1GB RAM.
- **Processing time**: 
  - Cached lookups: ~0.5-1 second per 1,000 MACs
  - With API lookups: ~2-5 seconds per 1,000 MACs (depends on rate limits and network latency)
  - Visualization generation: Additional 1-3 seconds for HTML generation
- **Duplicate MAC handling**: Duplicate MAC addresses in input files are automatically deduplicated (last occurrence overwrites earlier ones).
- **File size limits**: No hard limits, but processing files with >100K unique MACs may be slow. Consider splitting very large files into batches.

### Network & API Behavior

- **Internet connectivity required**: API vendor lookups require internet access. Without connectivity, only cached vendors (from `oui_cache.json`) are available.
- **API timeout**: 5-second timeout per API request. Failed requests are retried with exponential backoff across multiple services.
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic rate limiting (1-2 seconds between calls) prevents API throttling. Service rotation handles temporary failures gracefully.
- **Offline operation**: After initial cache population, the tool works offline using cached data only. Un-cached MACs will appear as "Unknown" when offline.

### Verbose Output

Control debug output with the `NETVENDOR_VERBOSE` environment variable:

```bash
# Quiet mode (default) - only essential output
netvendor input_file.txt

# Verbose mode - detailed processing information
NETVENDOR_VERBOSE=1 netvendor input_file.txt
```

### Disk Space & Output Files

- **Output directory**: Requires write permissions. Creates `output/` directory if missing.
- **File sizes**: 
  - Device CSV: ~50 bytes per device
  - Port CSV (MAC tables only): ~200-500 bytes per port
  - HTML dashboard: ~30-80KB base + ~0.5KB per vendor
  - Vendor summary: ~50 bytes per vendor
- **Multiple runs**: Output files are overwritten by default. Previous outputs are not preserved unless manually backed up.

### Error Handling

- **Missing dependencies**: Tool exits with clear error message if required packages are missing.
- **Invalid input files**: Malformed lines are silently skipped; processing continues for valid entries.
- **API failures**: Failed vendor lookups are cached in `failed_lookups.json` to avoid repeated attempts. These appear as "Unknown" in output.
- **Write failures**: If output directory cannot be created or files cannot be written, the tool exits with an error message.

## üì• Supported Input Formats

NetVendor automatically detects and parses the following formats:

### 1. Simple MAC Address List

```
00:11:22:33:44:55
00-11-22-33-44-55
001122334455
0011.2233.4455
```

### 2. MAC Address Tables (Multi-vendor)

```
Vlan    Mac Address       Type        Ports
10      0011.2233.4455    DYNAMIC     Gi1/0/1
20      00:0E:83:11:22:33 DYNAMIC     ge-0/0/0
30      B8:AC:6F:77:88:99 DYNamic     1:1
```

- **Cisco:** `0011.2233.4455`, `Gi1/0/1`
- **HP/Aruba:** `00:24:81:44:55:66`, `1`
- **Juniper:** `00:0E:83:11:22:33/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`, `ge-0/0/0`
- **Extreme:** `B8-AC-6F-77-88-99/ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff`, `1:1`
- **Brocade:** `00:11:22:33:44:55/ffff.ffff.ffff`, `1/1`

### 3. ARP Tables

```
Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
Internet  192.168.1.1      -          0011.2233.4455  ARPA   Vlan10
```
